Tranquil
========

Tranquil is a Sinatra app that acts as a basic framework for building status
boards like the one used by
[Panic](http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/).  Started
on a whim, it's intended to provide enough flexibility for anyone -- even
without a local installation.
